Comments:
* Code breaks grading scripts because you don't declare all variables at top
  of functions
* Good job on correctness!
* For readability, want to make sure lines of code don't exceed 80 chars.
* In several places, need more descriptive comments explaining the logic
  behind what you're doing.
